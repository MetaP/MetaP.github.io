## I love the internet

I love the internet.

As a developer I spend the biggest part of my day behind a computer. Most of the time I work from home. The internet connects my employer and his clients. So, it is extremely useful. But it is also an inexhaustible source of knowledge. I use it many times a day to find answers to a myriad of simple and not so simple questions: the exact syntax of a [for loop](https://www.google.com/search?q=typescript+for+loop) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), the best practices in ***domain-driven GUI development***... (Good luck with the latter! :-))

But it hasn't always been like that.

I remember a time that the internet didn't exist. I even remember a day that I felt excited because I was able to get a file from another PC to mine without the use of a floppy disk. (Both computers uses [Windows for Workgroups 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x#Windows_for_Workgroups) and where connected by a coax cable.) In those days we used beeping modems to connect computers over phone lines made from think bundles of tiny brass cables and an incredible speed of 14,400 bit/s and a PC with 1 Mb of internal memory and a hard disk op 10 was high-end. 
When I was almost six, I looked at a black and white TV screen, in a vacation house at the Belgian coast, and saw Neil Armstrong making that famous first step. (Actually, it was only years later that I saw that. At that moment I only saw the shadow of the LEM).

## I'd love to share

So, you probably think I am old. But... 

I don't feel old. Let's forget about age. It is of no importance. In a virtual world we can choose our avatar. I have seen so much and learned a lot and I feel the need to share it with you.
