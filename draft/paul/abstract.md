# The web as the universal manual  

On the world wide web it is easy to find the answer to concrete questions. But finding your way in a whole new domain is less evident.

We often the internet often via a search engine

This is probably because we often enter the internet

I would like to see ant like one giant textbook in which all knowledge that exists is stintergrated. You could start with the introduction and like any good . I woiold explain how the book is structured and even give you clues on how to read it, which parts to include and which you can omit, to reach a particular goal.

Of course on the internet pages are not ordered sequentially, they are linked. Linked pages form a graph, much more complex that a . A sequence can be processed from first element to last. We can start reading the book at the first page. When done, we continue with the second page and so on till we read the last one. In a graph, there is no such evident ordering. One can get lost and become stuck in a loop.
Would it be possible to use such a graph as a textbook to discover a new knowledge domain.

That kind of knowledge is very difficult to find. 

## Terminology

A handbook is often a compendium in a particular domain (field or technique) It is designed to be easily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area.

A tutorial, in education, is a method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of a learning process. More interactive and specific than a book or a lecture, a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.

Intended to be used by humans who want to acquire knowledge of a particular domain or deepen it.
